           <em>Malaga: Andalusia in Spain </em>
        </h2>
        <br>

        <p>
            Andalusia, particularly the Malaga region, is a great place to visit for a weekend trip. Because you are closer to the equator, the temperatures are nice for the most of the year. Malaga is one of the most well-known cities in Spain. This city has it all: tasty tapas, shops, museums, and, perhaps most importantly, beaches and the sea to cool off in. Malaga, a classic port city, is a tiny town that can easily be explored in two days.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
            We chose to stay outside of the city, in a Finca, a traditional rural house, rather than in the city. This Spanish home is roughly a 40-minute drive from Malaga, right outside the municipality of Almogia. Here, in the centre of the hills, surrounded by olive groves and winding roads, it is incredibly serene.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3> Day 1: Visting Malaga</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            In Malaga, we begin the day with a great breakfast at Cazorla. A wine and tapas bike excursion is next on the agenda. This trip takes us through the city's highlights. The Roman theatre, the bullfighting ring, the graffiti area, and a vast indoor market are among the attractions. We stop at Bodega Antigua Casa de Guardia, which sells a variety of wine liqueurs. We continue cycling after sampling a few, but not before the waiter rings the bell, signalling that they are our tip.
        </p>

        
        <br>
        
        <p>
            <b>Lunch:</b> We rest on Malaga's beach after the bike excursion (Playa la Malagueta). The beach is beautiful, however there are a lot of brown jellyfish in the water. Swimming becomes quite unappealing as a result of this. We visit the Castillo de Gibralfaro at the start of the evening. On top of the Gibralfaro mountain stands a Moorish fortress. A lovely spot to see the sunset. The city of Malaga, the harbour, and the shoreline can all be seen from here. To reach here, you must go up a steep hill for half an hour, either along the castle wall or on the outside. Of course, driving up the mountain is also an option.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Day 2: Antequera and Caminito Del Rey</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Antequera is a mediaeval city where much of the period's architecture can still be seen. There are several historic churches, so many that Antequera appears to have the highest number of churches per square metre in Spain. Antequera's setting is breathtaking, with the centrepiece being Alcazabe de Antequera, a Moorish castle perched atop a cliff above the city. We go to the Moorish castle, which is stunning with the backdrop of the Andalusia mountains in the background.

        <em>Mallorca: Favorite Hotspots </em>
    </h2>
    <br>
        <p>
            We were on a plane to Majorca when our own nation went 'orange.' We planned a long weekend in Mallorca a few weeks ago on the spur of the moment. We did not celebrate King's Day in Amsterdam, but we did celebrate King's Night. Taking a trip to Majorca turned out to be a fantastic idea! We arrived at Palma de Majorca after a short night with one purpose in mind: relax and enjoy the Spanish food and good wines!
        </p>
    
    <br>

        <p>
            Mallorca is a really beautiful island. However, Mallorca has a reputation for being a German enclave where beer and bratwurst can be purchased on every street corner, although this is no longer the case. If you enjoy active vacations, Majorca is the place to be: it is Spain's cycling Walhalla. Majorca is a stunning island with breathtaking scenery in our opinion. The environment in the west is rugged and steep. Long stretches of beach, ideal for swimming, may be found towards the east. Palma de Mallorca, the island's capital, is frequently likened to Barcelona! This bustling city is home to creative stores, cosy eateries, and some beautiful old structures!
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            Long stretches of beach and bays with a clear blue sea. Below is a selection of our favourite beaches on the island of Mallorca. These beaches are easily accessible by automobile (rental). There are four beaches worth visiting:
            <ul>
                <li>Playa Mondrago is without a doubt Mallorca's best beach. It's really a series of beaches joined by a lovely natural reserve. The sea is a brilliant blue, and the scenery is breathtaking!</li>
                <li>Playa es Trenc is a lengthy stretch of sandy beach with crystal blue water.</li>
                <li>Sant Elm is a charming tiny community with a beautiful beach.</li>
                <li>Cala Deia is a little charming beach on Mallorca's west coast. Restaurant Ca's Patro March is also located here.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3> Why to visit Mallorca ? </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Mallorca is a large island in the Mediterranean Sea. To see the entire island, you'll need a few days. Hikers can choose from a variety of multi-day hikes and cycling routes in Mallorca. Some bays have been 'colonised' by Germans and English individuals, who drink all day and live only for the purpose of partying. These locations are simple to avoid, and you may spend your time on more lovely beaches.
